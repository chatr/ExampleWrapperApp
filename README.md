# Cloudflare Apps Wrapper Example

This is an example app for [Cloudflare Apps](https://cloudflare.com/apps).

The app modifies the background color of websites in an amusing, if useless,
way.  To try it out download this project to your computer, and open the folder
in the [App Creation Tool](http://cloudflare.com/apps/developer/upload-an-app).

It is an example of an app which doesnâ€™t add any UI to the page, but instead just
adds some JavaScript and CSS.  For more information about Eager and developing
apps, please visit the [developer docs](http://cloudflare.com/apps/developer/docs/).

As always, you can contact us at [app-developer-help@cloudflare.com](mailto:app-developer-help@cloudflare.com)
with any questions or concerns.
